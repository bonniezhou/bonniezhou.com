      <p>
        Although I grew up with a traditional STEM background, Iâ€™ve begun to consider myself first as an artist and spiritual being<span class="tape-yellow">.</span> 
        <br>I define spirituality as the connection with oneself, with others, and with the world<span class="tape-yellow">.</span>
        <br>Through art I explore aspects of this connection such as belonging, worthiness, gender, and acceptance<span class="tape-yellow">.</span>
        <br>My primary artistic medium is dance, music and the body, but I also express myself through photography, writing, and code<span class="tape-yellow">.</span>
