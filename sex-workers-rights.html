      <h2 class="paragraph">Sex work is work.</h2>
      <p class="paragraph body-text">It seems that even in today's progressive communities, the rights of sex workers are often left out of the feminist movement because there is still huge stigma and controversy around sex work.</p>
      
      <p class="paragraph body-text">In 2015, an
        <a href="http://catwinternational.org/Content/Images/Article/617/attachment.pdf">open letter</a>
        was signed by many major celebrities to urge Amnesty International to reconsider their
        <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/amnesty-international-publishes-policy-and-research-on-protection-of-sex-workers-rights/">proposal</a>
        for decriminalizing sex work.
        In 2016 and 2017, the <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/notastripper-pole-dancing-instagram/">#NotAStripper</a>
        hashtag was trending amongst pole dancers who wanted to distance themselves from the taboo of stripping. But the form of pole dance that is popular today was
        <a href="https://theevolutionofpoledancing.blog/">created</a>
        by strippers.
        In 2018,
        <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom">FOSTA/SESTA</a>
        was signed, a bill which intended to curb sex trafficking but actually increases the level of danger for sex workers. I urge you to read about why the criminalization of sex work and FOSTA/SESTA are harmful and contrary to women's rights.
